Ensure your pull request adheres to the **following guidelines**:

- Your project **needs** to make use of the NDMF Framework.

- It would be **appreciable** if your package had an **English** documentation available

Thank you for your suggestions !

If your package doesn't follow all of those rules, but you consider that it would be interesting to add, you can suggest it and it can be referenced in a **Upcomming Section**. This allows to keep the curated list clean and only add packages that are with a certain amount of features.

## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
